# accessibility-resources

This repository is supposed to eventually become an extensive "wiki" of all things accessibility. I will be writing this in a way that helps me the most as an engineer and as a software developer, you may have vastly different needs or a different background so you might benefit more from another repository. Nonetheless, if you feel like you are able to contribute to this repository/project by adding information, please do.

# Root of wiki

This is the first page of this wiki type thing that is entirely built on .md files. This page also works as a root, every page links back to this one.

**Articles:**
- Tools that I recommend you to use and something on how I use them and maybe more [here](https://github.com/vilppes/accessibility-resources/TOOLS.md)
- Problems that are currently not fully solved or problems that have solutions to them, but are still causing issues [here](https://github.com/vilppes/PROBLEMS.md)
