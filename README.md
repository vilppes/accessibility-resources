# accessibility-resources

This repository is supposed to eventually become an extensive "wiki" of all things accessibility. I will be writing this in a way that helps me the most as an engineer and as a software developer, you may have vastly different needs or a different background so you might benefit more from another repository. Nonetheless, if you feel like you are able to contribute to this repository/project by adding information, please do.

# Root of wiki

This is the first page of this wiki type thing that is entirely built on .md files. This page also works as a root, every page links back to this one.

TODO: add a page for tools or something

TODO: add a page for the problems that cause the need for these tools
